Hi ! Welcome to my corner on the internet. 
I am Nikhil. R, an undergrad from BITS Pilani, Pilani campus. I am a professional poker player and entrepreneur. I also spent the last 2 years working at Flipkart as a Product manger trying to prevent fraud at the Fintech platform, building data pipelines and securing PII data for their data platform. This blog is for the projects I work on in computer security and in general a place to hang my ramblings. 

You can contact me at rnikhil96@outlook.com
