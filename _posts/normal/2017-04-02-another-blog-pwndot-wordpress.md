#pwndot

I moving some selected posts and all infosec related ramblings into another blog where I hope to post more frequenlty. I don't always want the flexibility offered by Jekyll, but rather a simple blogging tool to write posts and publish fast. The decision came into being after I noticed the huge number of drafts I have saved here without publishing. 

This site is now dedicated to general non technical musings and for my resume/projects.
