# Why I want to keep a journal of my thoughts ?

First I find them very amusing. They are mine and mine alone. I can twist and turn everything in my world. It's the reason I don't feel alone. I want to write not because I want people to read it. Of course I would be happy if people enjoy it but that is not why. I write because I cannot hold it. It's like a bottle with a fizzy drink. Once shaken up, it has to explode. Writing is like the whistle on a pressure cooker. It has to erupt. The steam has to escape and become air. The ink has to escape and become words. I Don't remember nouns, verbs or what my 10th standard english teacher taught me. All, I know about language is that it's used to express<a href="">.</a>It expresses. It reveals. I want to let things the way the idea is formed at its birthplace. Raw emotion. If you may call it. It shouldn't be disciplined/limited with words as long as the feeling is conveyed. Do justice to the feeling. Live the emotion.
