# Work experience

* **Google Summer of Code 2016 with LabLua - Sailor Web Framework**

Integrated Elasticsearch with Sailor so that ES indexes can now be stored/searched as Sailor models providing interoperability between both systems. Developed a centralized configuration editor to change config settings on the fly without reloading the entire application. Also working on the centralized plugin system to integrate third party extensions into Sailor

_Technologies Used_: Lua, Elasticsearch REST API

* **Vedanta Resources Ltd. (Summer 2015)**

Analyzed and automated the data reporting and logging system at the Jharsuguda Plant saving around 70 hours of manual labor monthly. Personally appreciated by the Vice President(Operations) for the aggregation system and it was immediately put into production. 

_Technologies Used_: Python, Python-excel packages like openpyxl, xlutils etc

* **Technical Lead  SSMS BITS Pilani (April 2015 - May 2016)**

Led a 4 member team to develop a billing and inventory management system which is being put into use daily at all messes and canteens to handle transactions of about â‚¹6 Million monthly for all 4500 registered students.

_Technologies Used_ : LAMP stack.

# Projects

Projects I have worked on in no particular order.

* **PintOS**

Extended the OS by adding virtual memory, message passing queues, POSIX threads and OS-level semaphores. Implemented "fork" and "exec" system calls and the ability to run user program. Implemented indexed filesystem, hierarchical directory structure and buffer cache.

_Technologies Used_: C

* **DoctorsNow**

Built the entire appointment booking and video calling system for doctors and patients. Patients can schedule appointments in advance, book slots for video calling and review their previous visits. The product has been now ported to Android and IoS and the startup launched as Visit.

_Technologies Used_: PHP, Slim Framework, WebRTC for the video calls

* **Tracker**

It is to help developers jump start developing any kind of mobility tracking applications. Tracker let's any type or number of GPS enabled endpoints to send data to a NodeJs server which then maps their location history using Google Maps API. 

_Technologies Used_: Javascript, NodeJS, Google Maps API

* **Portsmith**

A secure Port Knocking Implementation in Python using single packet authorization. Uses TCP and IND-CCA secure requests to open a port on the server. Uses hping3 to craft TCP packets. The knock packet is encrypted using the key transferred from the server and then sent to the knockport. It gets logged into kern.log which is read by Portsmith. It is then decrypted and the required port is then opened for the sourceIP using a custom iptables command. There is also an integrated SOCKS proxy to perform knocks before routing application traffic. Currently working on a kernel module implementation using Netfilter hooks, nftables and cryptographic primitives instead of high level libraries.

_Technologies Used_: Python, Cryptography Library( Fernet Symmetric Encryption )

* **Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol**

Was involved in the building a statistics module for an application layer streaming protocol in Python. It records information related to the stream, number of peers (audience) per minute, in/out of peers, total peers, etc. Wrote an graphical interface for viewing the numbers built using d3.js.

_Technologies Used_: Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript (D3.js)

* **MicroTracer**

System Call tracer for Linux based systems which displays the syscalls used by a particular program in a neatly formatted manner without the complex details as shown by programs like strace. 

_Technologies Used_: C
